# Data Science Applications to Astronomy
## Penn State Astro 416

This course is designed to increase students' data acumen and experience in how building data science skills can benefit astronomy & astrophysics research. Students analyze data from astronomical surveys to detect and characterize astronomical objects and astronomical populations. Students will build practical data science skills (e.g., querying astronomical databases, efficient approaches for data storage and manipulation, exploratory and explanatory data analysis, Bayesian modeling workflows, effective data visualization, and reproducible research practices). Students will also gain a basic familiarity with core data science terms and concepts, so they can effectively communicate with data scientists, whether working in astronomy or in industry. Astro 416 is designed to be complementary to Astro 410, Astro 415, and Astro 451.
